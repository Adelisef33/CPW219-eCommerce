# Here will be a roadmap of planned upcoming improvements and implications for the eCommerce website. 

- Styling with Bootstrap 5
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with Entity Framework Core
- Login/Register
- Shopping Cart

## More may be added, depends on how well the current implementations go. :)
